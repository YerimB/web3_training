# web3_training

Tiny projects on Web3.0 interacting with Ethereum using Solidity & Python3.  
Some of the projects use the [brownie framework](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (which uses the [web3.py library](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)) while others use the web3.py library itself.
